      <h2>Honoring Every Woman’s Journey</h2>
      <p>At FemiBloom Yoga, we understand that motherhood is not a one-size-fits-all journey. Our approach supports every individual—whether you’re trying to conceive, nurturing a pregnancy, or navigating the postpartum phase. We honor your experience and body, embracing diversity in all its forms.</p>

      <h3>Prenatal Yoga</h3>
      <p>Empowering expectant mothers with gentle poses, breathing techniques, and mindfulness to support physical and emotional well-being during pregnancy.</p>

      <h3>Postnatal Wellness</h3>
      <p>Helping mothers rebuild strength, manage stress, and find inner balance through healing movements and community support.</p>

      <h3>Conscious Motherhood (Inspired by Garbhasanskar)</h3>
      <p>Our “Conscious Motherhood” program encourages bonding with the baby through affirmations, gentle music, storytelling, and mindful rituals rooted in both ancient and modern wellness science.</p>

      <h3>Beyond Perfection</h3>
      <p>You don't have to be an Instagram mom. You are enough as you are—beautiful, nurturing, resilient. Our safe and inclusive space helps you rediscover your inner strength and softness without filters or pressure.</p>
