    <h1>About FemiBloom Yoga</h1>
    <p>
      At FemiBloom Yoga, we blend the wisdom of ancient Eastern practices with the comfort and clarity expected in the Western world. 
      We offer nurturing yoga experiences tailored for women trying to conceive, expectant mothers, and new moms. 
      Our approach includes conscious motherhood practices, yoga for every trimester, postnatal recovery support, and 
      holistic wellness tools that align with modern lifestyles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired by the essence of GarbhaSamskar (translated here as "Womb Wisdom Rituals"), our sessions aim to support emotional well-being, bonding, and inner calm. 
      We welcome every race, every background, and every unique journey. 
      Here, you’ll find warmth, inclusivity, and guidance as you step into one of life’s most powerful transformations.
